# expense-tracker
My name is KARTIK , Regd.number 25BAI11154 branch computer science and Engineering (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning). This is my Vityarthi Project code and screenshots which are attached with my GitHub Repository and my project name is Expense Tracker. This Expense Tracker is developed using Python with the Flask framework, combined with HTML and CSS for creating a clean and interactive user interface. The main purpose of this project is to help users record, manage, and review their daily expenses in a simple and organized way. Users can add a new expense by entering the title, amount, and date, and all entries are neatly displayed in a table where each expense can also be deleted whenever needed. The application automatically calculates the total amount spent, giving a quick overview of the user’s financial activity. For storing data, the project uses an SQLite database, which makes setup extremely easy since everything is saved in a single file without requiring any external configurations. Python handles the backend logic, such as adding, retrieving, and deleting expenses; Flask manages routing and communication between pages; HTML structures the layout of the web pages; and CSS is used to style the application with modern colors, animations, and responsive design to ensure it works smoothly on both mobile and desktop. This project demonstrates how frontend, backend, and database layers work together in real applications.
